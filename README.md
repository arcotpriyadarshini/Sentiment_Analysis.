Sentiment Analysis

The goal of this project is to create a sentiment analysis model that will enable us to classify words
according to their sentiments specifically, whether they are good, negative, or how strong they are. R will be used to
create the project. To evaluate the data and assign scores to the appropriate terms that are present in the dataset, we will
utilize the small text package.
